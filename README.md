# MLOps Docker Tutorial

Welcome to the **MLOps Docker Tutorial** repository!  
This guide is designed to help you understand how Docker can be used in MLOps workflows to build, package, and deploy applications consistently across environments.

---

## Why Docker?

When developing an application, it often relies on:
- Specific OS configurations
- A particular version of a programming language
- A virtual environment with compatible packages
- Additional runtime dependencies

Now imagine sharing this application with another team. If their environment differs even slightly, the application might fail with the infamous **“It works on my machine”** problem.

**Docker solves this problem** by packaging your application and its entire environment into a **container**, ensuring it runs reliably on any system.

## What is Docker?

Docker is a platform that helps developers:
- Build applications
- Package them with all required dependencies
- Deploy them in a consistent, portable, and scalable way

Docker containers encapsulate your code, libraries, environment settings, and more — making your app **truly environment-independent**.

---

## Key Benefits of Docker

### Portability
Docker containers run consistently across:
- Developer laptops
- Testing environments
- Production servers
- Any cloud platform

> Build once, run anywhere.

---

### Isolation
Each Docker container is **isolated**:
- No conflict between apps
- Easier testing of different components side by side

---

### Scalability
Containers are lightweight and quick to spin up. For example:
> You run a social media app on a server that handles 100 users.  
Suddenly, 500 users join.  
You can **scale horizontally** by spinning up more containers instantly — each with the same dependencies and configuration.

## Docker vs Virtual Machines

| Feature | Docker | Virtual Machines |
|--------|--------|------------------|
| OS | Shares host OS | Full guest OS |
| Resource Use | Lightweight | Heavy (RAM, storage) |
| Startup Time | Seconds | Minutes |
| Use Case | Ideal for microservices, scalable deployments | Better for complete OS isolation |

**Example:**

- You have a Windows machine.
- You install two VMs: one Linux, one Mac. Each behaves like a separate computer — using significant system resources.
- In contrast, Docker containers reuse the host OS and are **more efficient** for lightweight and modular applications.

## Docker Engine: Core Components

Docker Engine is the runtime that makes Docker work. It includes:

### Docker Daemon (Server)
- Manages Docker containers, images, volumes, networks
- Listens for API requests and performs container operations

### REST API
- Interfaces between the Docker client and daemon

### Docker CLI (Client)
- Tool to interact with Docker via commands like:
```bash
docker run, docker build, docker ps
```

## The repository

It involves three steps:
1) Build a simple Flask application
2) requirements.txt
3) building a dockerfile
